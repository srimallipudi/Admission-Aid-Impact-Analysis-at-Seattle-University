# Seattle University Admission Aid Impact Analysis

## Project Overview:
At Seattle University, our project focused on evaluating the influence of including a financial Aid offer in admission letters on acceptance rates. This initiative was aimed at understanding how financial aid offerings influence the decisions of prospective students and optimizing aid allocation strategies to enhance enrollment outcomes.

## Data Collection:
To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we collected historical data pertaining to admission offers, financial aid packages, and enrollment outcomes. This dataset provided the foundation for our exploration into the relationship between funded aid offers and acceptance rates.

## Analysis Approach:
Our analysis primarily revolved around exploring the relationship between funded aid offers and acceptance rates to uncover potential patterns and insights driving enrollment decisions among prospective students. Notably, we identified demographic trends indicating that Females, US citizens, and individuals identifying as White exhibited higher acceptance rates, implying a greater responsiveness to financial aid offers.

## Key Findings:
1. Females, US citizens, and individuals identifying as White demonstrated higher acceptance rates in response to the offer of financial aid.
2. Certain programs, including MBA, MSBA, MSF, and MIT, have been particularly successful in disseminating funded aid, with acceptance rates exceeding 30% highlighting the importance of targeted aid initiatives.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, our analysis provided Seattle University with valuable insights into the impact of including funded aid offers in admission letters. By enhancing our understanding of enrollment dynamics and identifying effective aid distribution strategies, we contributed to improving enrollment outcomes and promoting equitable access to financial aid for all students.
